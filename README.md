# FFS: Firefox Stop; stops or continues a firefox process

Does Firefox use up too many resources while idling?  Do you want to extend
your laptop's battery life while on the road?  Maybe you just need to stop
the Firefox process and only continue it when you need to use Firefox again.

Usage:

    ffs [stop|cont]
